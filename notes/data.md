# Data

Due to their size, the raw input data are stored locally (i.e., not in this repo).

## VTD (Precinct) Data

The data for VTDs (precincts) came from these sources:

* The VTD census data came from https://github.com/dra2020/vtd_data.
* The VTD shapesfiles come from https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2020PL/LAYER/VTD/2020/.

These are some other data that I don't currently use:
