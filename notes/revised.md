# Revised Process

Do N times:
- Step 1: Balzer w/ random seeds -- Produces least energy and equal population districts that are not necessarily contiguous.
- Reassign regions to make districts contiguous.
- Step 2: Balzer' w/ contiguous assignments -- Produces least energy and contiguous but not necessarily equal population districts.
- Reassign precincts to equalize district populations maintaining contiguity.
- Step 3: Balzer' w/ equalized assignments -- Produces least energy, contiguous, and equal population districts.

Pick lowest energy result. That's the baseline.
