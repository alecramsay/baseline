## Category 6

Special cases for one reason or another (all almost exactly equal populations):

In DRA, we only addressed operational contiguity issues for only two states with three or more congressional districts: CA & FL.
AK, HI, ME, NH, and RI -- all states with just two congressional districts -- also had contiguity issues which we didn't fix.
