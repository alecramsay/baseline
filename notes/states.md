## Category 3

Some water-only precincts & connectivity issues:

- NY: "There are 2 disconnected components. There is 1 island with id: 36061000084." (effectively almost equal populations)

## Category 4

Special cases for one reason or another (all almost exactly equal populations):

- CA: Uses tracts & BGs, has water-only precincts & connectivity issues:
- OR: Uses BGs instead of VTDs
- FL: Some missing xy data

In DRA, we only addressed operational contiguity issues for only two states with three or more congressional districts: CA & FL.
AK, HI, ME, NH, and RI -- all states with just two congressional districts -- also had contiguity issues which we didn't fix.
