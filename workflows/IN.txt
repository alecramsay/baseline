(6) scripts/compare_maps.py -s IN -i 100 -v

	* Copy any missing maps output to maps/IN/IN20C_missing.txt.
	* Import IN20C_candidates.csv into a spreadheet, and verify that the results are OK.

	Update the energies:

	scripts/update_energies.py -s IN
		
(7) Copy the lowest energy contiguous candidate with population deviation <= 2% to the maps/IN directory as IN20C_baseline_100.csv.
	
	IN20C_I088K01N09 <<< verified 06/26/23
