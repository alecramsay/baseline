(1) Create output directories

(2) scripts/extract_water_only.py -s CA > data/CA/CA_2020_water_only.csv

	There are 23 water-only BGs.
	
(3) scripts/extract_data.py -s CA -w
(4) scripts/extract_graph.py -s CA -w -a <= DONE thru here

(6) scripts/compare_maps.py -s CA -i 100 -v

	* Copy any missing maps output to maps/CA/CA20C_missing.txt.
	* Import CA20C_candidates.csv into a spreadheet, and verify that the results are OK.
	
(7) Copy the lowest energy contiguous candidate with population deviation <= 2% to the maps/CA directory as CA20C_baseline_100.csv.

pg:

(5) scripts/import_base_map.sh CA

	Verify the map in DRA.

(6) Open the map in DRA:
	* Set the Colors and Overlays -- 'Change Palette' to Plasma
	* Copy the Share link guid to constants.py in both the 'baseline' and 'pg' repos
	* Export the block-assignment file
	* Rename it to CA_2020_Congress_Baseline.csv <<< NOTE - 2020 not 2022, and 'Baseline' not 'baseline'
	* Move it to the data/CA/ folder
(7) scripts/pull_map_ratings.sh CA Congress Baseline xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
(8) Tweak each duplicated Official and Notable map in DRA
	* CA_2022_Congress_Compact_map.png
	* CA_2022_Congress_Competitive_map.png
	* CA_2022_Congress_Minority_map.png
	* CA_2022_Congress_Official_map.png
	* CA_2022_Congress_Proportional_map.png
	* CA_2022_Congress_Splitting_map.png
	* Move them to the docs/assets/images/ folder
	* Add the maps to the Group
(9) scripts/analyze_state.py CA


(10) Add population deviation & runtime to the abstract spreadsheet

	cat intermediate/CA/CA20C_log_100.txt | awk 'END{print}'
	
(11) Turn the state on in the website

	* Add the Share link guid to states.yml and flip the 'ready' property for the state to 'true'
	* On the state's page in docs/_pages/pages/CA.markdown, change the layout to 'state' and remove the NYI one-liner
