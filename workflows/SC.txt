NOTE

- Notable splitting map replaced and analysis re-run 07/04/23.

--------
baseline:

(1) Create output directories

(2) scripts/extract_water_only.py -s SC > data/SC/SC_2020_water_only.csv

	There are no water-only VTDs (precincts)
	
(3) scripts/extract_data.py -s SC

	Ran this separately 08/21/23

	scripts/extract_blocks_by_vtd.py -s SC

(4) scripts/extract_graph.py -s SC

	Ran through here 06/21/23.
		
(5) scripts/baseline_state.py -s SC -i 100 -c -v > intermediate/SC/SC20C_log_100.txt

(6) scripts/compare_maps.py -s SC -i 100 -v

	* Copy any missing maps output to maps/SC/SC20C_missing.txt.
	* Import SC20C_candidates.csv into a spreadheet, and verify that the results are OK.

	Update the energies:

	scripts/update_energies.py -s SC

	Ran through here 06/24/23.
		
(7) Copy the lowest energy contiguous candidate with population deviation <= 2% to the maps/SC directory as SC20C_baseline_100.csv.

	SC20C_I076K01N07 => SC20C_I080K01N07 <<< Updated 06/28/23

pg:

(4) Analyze the official & notable maps relative to the baseline map

    - scripts/analyze_state_part1.py -s SC
    - scripts/analyze_state_part2.py -s SC

(5) Deploy the artifacts

    - scripts/DEPLOY.py -s SC

(6) Turn the state on in the website

    [x] - Copy & paste the YAML fragment into the state.yml file. 
    [ ] - Change the state.md layout from 'page' to 'state.
    [ ] - Add qualitative analysis.
