baseline:

(1) Create output directories

(2) scripts/extract_water_only.py -s NC > data/NC/NC_2020_water_only.csv

	No water-only VTDs (precincts) for NC
	
(3) scripts/extract_data.py -s NC

	Ran this separately 08/04/23

	scripts/map_blocks_to_vtds.py -s NC

(4) scripts/extract_graph.py -s NC

	Ran through here 06/21/23.

--------

(5) scripts/baseline_state.py -s NC -i 100 -c -v > intermediate/NC/NC20C_log_100.txt

(6) scripts/compare_maps.py -s NC -i 100 -v

	* Copy any missing maps output to maps/NC/NC20C_missing.txt.
	* Import NC20C_candidates.csv into a spreadheet, and verify that the results are OK.

	Update the energies:

	scripts/update_energies.py -s NC

	Ran through here 06/23/23.

(7) Copy the lowest energy contiguous map with acceptable population deviation to the maps/NC directory as NC20C_baseline_100.csv.

	NC20C_I022K01N14 => NC20C_I092K01N14 <<< Updated 06/28/23

    Added population deviation & runtimes to the abstract spreadsheet

    - cat intermediate/NC/NC20C_log_100.txt | awk 'END{print}'

pg:

(4) Analyzed the official & notable maps relative to the baseline map

    - scripts/analyze_state_part1.py -s NC
    - scripts/analyze_state_part2.py -s NC

(5) Deployed the artifacts

    - scripts/DEPLOY.py -s NC

(6) Turned the state on in the website

    - Copy & paste the YAML fragment into the state.yml file.
