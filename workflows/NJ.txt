baseline:

(1) Create output directories

(2) scripts/extract_water_only.py -s NJ > data/NJ/NJ_2020_water_only.csv

	Five water-only precincts
	
(3) scripts/extract_data.py -s NJ -w
(4) scripts/extract_graph.py -s NJ -w
(5) scripts/baseline_state.py -s NJ -i 100 -c -v > intermediate/NJ/NJ20C_log_100.txt

	* Review "WARNING" messages in the log.

(6) scripts/compare_maps.py -s NJ -i 100 -v

	* Copy any missing maps output to maps/NJ/NJ20C_missing.txt.
	* Import NJ20C_candidates.csv into a spreadheet, and verify that the results are OK.
	
(7) Copy the lowest energy contiguous candidate with population deviation <= 2% to the maps/NJ directory as NJ20C_baseline_100.csv.

	NJ20C_I081K01N12

--------

Assigned away from the rest of District 3, because of intervening water-only precincts:
34029025000,Berkeley township Island Beach State Park
34029025000,0,-74.09064102444029,39.83416263428525

This precinct has no population and only causes a problem because of it's unique location.
	1. We could just manually fix this up, i.e., just handle this has a zero population landed precinct, or
	2. We could cull zero-population landed precincts too.
	
The latter would introduce a change to what Todd's code sees, so #1 seems like the way to go. It handles "normal"
zero population landed precincts.

(5) scripts/import_base_map.sh NJ

	Verify the map in DRA.

(6) Open the map in DRA:
	* Set the Colors and Overlays -- 'Change Palette' to Plasma
	* Copy the Share link guid to constants.py in both the 'baseline' and 'pg' repos
	* Export the block-assignment file
	* Rename it to NJ_2020_Congress_Baseline.csv <<< NOTE - 2020 not 2022, and 'Baseline' not 'baseline'
	* Move it to the data/NJ/ folder
(7) scripts/pull_map_ratings.sh NJ Congress Baseline xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
(8) Tweak each duplicated Official and Notable map in DRA
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Compact_map.png
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Competitive_map.png
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Minority_map.png
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Official_map.png
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Proportional_map.png
	* NJ_2022_Congress_Splitting_map.png
	* Move them to the docs/assets/images/ folder
	* Add the maps to the Group
(9) scripts/analyze_state.py NJ


(10) Add population deviation & runtime to the abstract spreadsheet

	cat intermediate/NJ/NJ20C_log_100.txt | awk 'END{print}'
	
(11) Turn the state on in the website

	* Add the Share link guid to states.yml and flip the 'ready' property for the state to 'true'
	* On the state's page in docs/_pages/pages/NJ.markdown, change the layout to 'state' and remove the NYI one-liner
